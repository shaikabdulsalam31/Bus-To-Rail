        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Bus-TO-Rail is a website created with the motive of providing easier access to bus routes, rail routes, and
            BMTC routes for public transport travelers. Our aim is to make the journey planning process convenient and
            hassle-free.</p>
        <p>Our website offers comprehensive information about various bus routes, rail routes, and BMTC routes,
            empowering travelers to make informed decisions about their commute. We understand the importance of having
            up-to-date and accurate information, so we strive to keep our database regularly updated.</p>
        <p>In addition to route information, we also provide important helpline numbers for emergencies and other
            essential contacts. We believe that access to reliable helpline numbers is crucial for ensuring the safety
            and well-being of our users.</p>
        <p>RailtoBus was created by Shaik Abdul Salam and Trupti Gouda, two enthusiastic 3rd-year ECE students studying
            at UVCE Bangalore. With a passion for technology and a commitment to improving public transportation, we
            embarked on this project to contribute to the community and simplify the travel experience for everyone.</p>
